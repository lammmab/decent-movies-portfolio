# Decentralized Movies
The final portfolio project version of my decentralized movies repository

## Description
Decentralized movies is a full-stack, decentralized movie platform written entirely by me.
My choice of stack is Node.JS, with SvelteKit for the frontend, and an Electron/Capacitor wrapper for cross-platform support.

Features:
- Centralized login / AUTH / saves server for persistent progress across backends
- Decentralized backend server with easy plugin support for providing content from sources
- Partly centralized frontend that can be spun up to connect to the login and backend servers.
